# for-high-school

There's never a place where code isn't at least a little useful!

Here's some code I wrote for CS-unrelated stuff in high school.

## mdm4u-final
Code used for the final project in Data Management.

Thanks Mr. Saayman for letting students use various tools (Python in my case)!

## sbi4u
Code for doing DNA transcription and RNA translation.

Just run `python translator.py` to use.

## cgw4u-isodemographic-map
For making the isodemographic map!

The Python Pillow library was used to determine the country shapes.
